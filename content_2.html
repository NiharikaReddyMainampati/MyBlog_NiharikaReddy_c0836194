                <p class="">Drawing, the art or technique of producing images on a surface, usually paper, by means of marks, usually of ink, graphite, chalk, charcoal, or crayon.<br><br>

                 One of my hobbies is drawing. Drawing as a formal creative work can be characterised as the predominantly linear portrayal of observable world objects, as well as visual representations of concepts, thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and fantasies, symbols, and even abstract forms. This definition, on the other hand, encompasses all graphic arts and techniques that, like painting, place a greater focus on form or shape than mass and colour. I enjoy painting because it helps me forget about my worries and stimulates my mind with new ideas. It assists me in enhancing my creativity and allowing me to use my imagination in whatever way I see fit. The most crucial reason, though, is that it makes me happy all the time. Besides, I have won several awards since childhood in almost every drawing competition.</p>

                <p class="">Dance, rhythmic movement of the body, usually to music and within a specific space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, releasing energy, or simply enjoying the movement itself.<br><br>

                Dance is a tremendous instinct, but the art of dance is the channelling of that impulse by skilled performers into something that is extremely expressive and may pleasure spectators who have no desire to dance. The two most essential connecting notions running through any discussion of the issue are dancing as a compelling impulse and dance as a well choreographed art done mostly by a professional few. Dance has a stronger link between the two notions than other art forms, and neither can exist without the other.</p>

                <p class="">Music is the technique of organising sounds in time using melodic, harmonic, rhythmic, and timbral aspects.</p>

                <p class="">A collection of coordinated sound or sounds is referred to as music. Making music entails arranging sounds and tones in a specific order, often combining them to form a cohesive composition. People who compose music use sound to achieve a certain result, such as a Beethoven symphony or a Duke Ellington jazz song. Music is made up of noises, vibrations, and quiet moments, and it doesn't have to be pleasant or beautiful all of the time. It can be used to portray a wide range of emotions, events, and settings.</p>
